    "\n",
    "When visiting or moving to a new city there can be difficulties when trying to choose or discover restaurants, stores and other local venues to explore in the neighborhoods. This can be daunting for both a user and business perspective when venturing forth into new territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring new neighborhoods, there is a difficult task of analyzing various forms of criteria that can drastic impact your decision making. Such factors include, distance, price tier, ratings, photos and tips which is a lot of criteria too look through. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Philadelphia area has many universities and colleges make it a top study destination, as the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub, with an estimated gross metropolitan product of $490 billion in 2019. This makes the twelve neighborhoods of Philadelphia a hot spot for new residents, travelers and businesses. The twelve neighborhoods of Philadelphia are Center City, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, Lower North Philadelphia, Upper North Philadelphia, Bridesburg-Kensington-Port Richmond, Roxborough-Manayunk, Germantown-Chestnut Hill, Olney-Oak Lane, Near Northeast Philadelphia and Far Northeast Philadelphia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toronto is an international center for business, finance, arts and culture in the provincial capital of Ontario. Toronto is also an education and economic hub with diversified strengths in technology, design, food services, education and many more. This makes the six neighborhoods a hot spot for new residents, travelers and businesses much like Philadelphia. The six neighborhoods that make up Toronto are Old City of Toronto, East York, Etobicoke, Scarborough, York and North York.\n"

    "### 1.2 Problem\n",
    "With the utilization of Foursquare venue data we can utilize this to explore and compare the city of Philadelphia and Toronto. This project will focus on how this data can be used to find new insights required for business opportunities in certain neighborhoods, cluster and segment venues to provide for a better user experience. We can then also compare and distinguish which city venues are better.\n",
    "\n",
    "By segmenting and clustering venues based on our Foursquare venue data, we can compare and distinguish venue similarities to observe which neighborhoods would be good business ventures. Also, we will utilize factors such as user likes, ratings, tips, photos and distance to venues to seek if there are correlations that exist."

    "Interested parties might include business start-ups, stakeholders, and existing owners. Business start-ups might be looking for areas that lack certain categorical venues to further enhance a neighborhoods overall experience. Stakeholders would also be interested in this and also as a means to see how their invested interests are performing as a whole comparatively within city neighborhoods and to another city. Existing business will also benefit to see how the venues likes, tips and photos will bring effectiveness on their price tie and ratings."

Thus, we look at the boroughs overall and only the top 25 venues in each borough. We are also limited by the amount of available data provided by foursquare at each of these venues, as they can be missing important information pertaining to our regression analyses. As such, this is more a modeling of what is possible with our the queriable data and could be expanded upon when limitations are lifted."
